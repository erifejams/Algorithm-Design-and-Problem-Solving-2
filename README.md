# Algorithm-Design-and-Problem-Solving

Tasks included in this project:
1. Depth First (DF) Traversal of connected graph using both recursion and iteration. 
2. A modification of DF to count the number of connected components in a disconnected graph. 
3. Prim's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree for a weighted connected graph. 
4. 2 connected graphs and 1 disconnected graph to test prim's algorithm and modification of DF program
5. Documentation/Report of work
